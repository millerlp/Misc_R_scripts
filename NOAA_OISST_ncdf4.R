# NOAA_OISST_ncdf4.R
# Functions to extract mean sea surface temperature data from NOAA's Optimum 
# Interpolated Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) v2 High Resolution daily or
# weekly datasets.
# Daily data are available on a 1/4deg global grid. 
# Weekly data are available on a 1deg global grid.
# Windows users, note that you'll need to manually download the ncdf4 package
# from http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncdf/, since it is not available 
# directly from CRAN. David Pierce is the author of the ncdf4 package. 

# See http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html
# for information about the year-long OISST v2 daily files.

# See http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html
# for more information about the weekly OISST v2 files

# See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sst/griddata.php 
# for more information about the single-day AVHRR OISST files
